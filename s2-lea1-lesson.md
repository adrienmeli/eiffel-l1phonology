## What we know so far

* The transcription of ALL consonants
* The following vowels: 
  - \textipa{I}
  - \textipa{eI}
  - \textipa{aI}
  - \textipa{aU}



Let's add:

* \textipa{@U} as in "road" (/\textipa{r@Ud}/) or "go" (/\textipa{g@U}/)
* \textipa{i:} as in "piece" (/\textipa{pi:s}/) or "lead" (/\textipa{li:d}/)
* \textipa{e} as in "bed" (/\textipa{bed}/) or "said" (/\textipa{sed}/)
* \textipa{A:} as in "car" (/\textipa{kA:}/) or "bath" (/\textipa{bA:T}/)

**\color[HTML]{f44336}BEWARE!! \color{black}** 
- \textipa{A:} (long vowel)
- /a/ is only found in diphthongs \textipa{aI } and \textipa{aU}
