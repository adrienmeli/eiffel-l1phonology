## What we know so far

* The transcription of ALL consonants
* The following vowels: 
  - /\textipa{I}/
  - /\textipa{eI}/
  - /\textipa{aI}/
  - /\textipa{aU}/



Let's add:

* /\textipa{@U}/ as in "road" (/\textipa{r@Ud}/) or "go" (/\textipa{g@U}/)
* /\textipa{i:}/ as in "piece" (/\textipa{pi:s}/) or "lead" (/\textipa{li:d}/)
* /\textipa{e}/ as in "bed" (/\textipa{bed}/) or "said" (/\textipa{sed}/)
* /\textipa{A:}/ as in "car" (/\textipa{kA:}/) or "bath" (/\textipa{bA:T}/)

**\color[HTML]{f44336}BEWARE!! \color{black}** 
- /\textipa{A:}/ (long vowel)
- /a/ is only found in diphthongs /\textipa{aI }/ and /\textipa{aU}/
